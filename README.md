- 👋 Hi, I’m @juanzabal
- 👀 I'm 23 years old and since I graduated high school I've been a film student at Buenos Aires' University but I'm currently looking for a carrer change. I’m interested in 
learning the basic and not so basic skills of web development and user design to become Fron-End Dev. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to become an active student at SoyHenry's BootCamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web and mobile based proyects that allow me to keep growing as a developer and strengthen my conversational and technical english.
